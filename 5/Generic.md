# Generic Programming

## Intro

There are two approaches to generic programming in Haskell:

- GHC Generics
- `generics-sop`

## Learning

### Learning `generics-sop`

1. Watch the [talk on YouTube]*(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQxH349HOik)
2. Read [Applying Type-Level and Generic Programming in Haskell](https://github.com/kosmikus/SSGEP/blob/master/LectureNotes.pdf): these notes incrementally build the necessary knowlege all the way up to using combinators of `generics-sop`

Both these materials are by the author Andres LoÌˆh.
